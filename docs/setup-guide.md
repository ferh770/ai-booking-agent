# 🚀 AI Booking Agent — Setup Guide for Clients

## ✅ STEP 1: Install the Booking Button on Your Website

Copy this code:

```html
<script src="https://your-widget-url.vercel.app/widget.js" data-business-id="YOUR_BUSINESS_ID" defer></script>
```

→ Paste it into your website’s HTML, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

Works on:
- WordPress (paste in “Footer” or “Custom HTML” block)
- Shopify (paste in `theme.liquid` before `</body>`)
- Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, custom HTML sites

Replace `YOUR_BUSINESS_ID` with the ID we assign you (e.g., `plumber_john_123`).
